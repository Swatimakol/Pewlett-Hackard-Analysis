# Project Purpose
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. A quick query helped inform Bobby number of retiring employees per title, and also he was able to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program


# Results

Bobby was able to query all the provided data of the company and determine employee status.

1. First we queried to make sure there are no duplictaes and then determined unique recent titles of all the employees.

2. Then got the count of all the titles in the company. This helped us determine senior positions. Nearly 30,000 Senior enginerr positions and roughly 29,000 had senior staff positions, respectively

3. Laslty using the above list, we were able to narrow down our results for employees who are close to retirement as per their age criteria

4. With the above results we were able to determine that only 2 employees have manager positions while he list of employees who can particpate in the mentorship program are many. The compnay can make the best use of it's resources and help the 2 managers.

All of these current retire-eligible employees have held different positions at Pewlett Hackard. According to the table below, nearly 14,000 and roughly 13,000 had senior engineer and engineer positions, respectively. Following this group, almost 13,000 and 12,000 had senior staff and staff positions, respectively. It was interesting to see that there were only a handful of manager positions. This could be a good opportunity for HR to investigate why there were so few managers.

determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


# Summary 

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

With the results we narrowed down, roughly 1550 employees will be coming to retirement soon. This will lead to a huge margin of roles to be filled by their predecessors. 


2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As per as the results most of the roles could be filled in by their predecessors except "Manager" and "Assistant Engineer". We only have two managers and if they take up Assistant engineer role, then we need to have new hires for a manager role. The low manager count also rules in the issue that we need more people to fill retiring Assistant engineer roles. 


Pewlett Hackard's HR firstly look into the reason for scarse Manager positions in their company. Once they dteremine that, they should look into hiring new employees before the silver tsunami wave starts. This process can help new hires get timely and resourceful mentoring from the senior employees of the company.
